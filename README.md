## TV Show Recommendation Generator
This project was created by Eddy n' Charles during CodeJam 2016 to give TV show recommendations to a user. We used The [Movie DB API](The Movie DB
https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to query for TV show information and wrote everything in mostly HTML/CSS/JavaScript with some minimal JavaScript libraries but no web JavaScript frameworks.

## Dependencies
* RequireJS 2.3.2
* jQuery 1.12.4

## Get Started
All you have to do is open "rateinstructions.html" in your Google Chrome browser!
